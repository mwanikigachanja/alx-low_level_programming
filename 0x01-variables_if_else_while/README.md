## Introduction

The 0x01-variables_if_else_while project is designed to help you gain a deeper understanding of variables, if-else statements, and loops in C programming. These are fundamental concepts that are widely used in programming and form the building blocks for more complex programs.

Through a series of tasks and exercises, this project provides you with opportunities to practice working with variables, writing if-else statements, and implementing loops. By completing these tasks, you will develop a solid foundation in C programming and improve your problem-solving skills.

## Project Files

The project files for 0x01-variables_if_else_while include:

- **0-positive_or_negative.c**: A C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` and determines if it is positive, negative, or zero.
- **1-last_digit.c**: A C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` and prints the last digit of that number.
- **2-print_alphabet.c**: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- **3-print_alphabets.c**: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- **4-print_alphabt.c**: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for the letters 'q' and 'e'.
- **5-print_numbers.c**: A C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10, starting from 0.
- **6-print_numberz.c**: A C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10, starting from 0, using only the `putchar` function.
- **7-print_tebahpla.c**: A C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, followed by a new line.
- **8-print_base16.c**: A C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- **9-print_comb.c**: A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by commas.
- **10-print_comb2.c**: A C program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers, separated by commas.
- **100-print_comb3.c**: A C program that prints all possible combinations of three-digit numbers, separated by commas.
- **101-print_comb4.c**: A C program that prints all possible combinations of four-digit numbers, separated by commas.
- **102-print_comb5.c**: A C program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, separated by spaces.
