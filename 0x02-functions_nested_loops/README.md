# 0x02 Functions and Nested Loops

Welcome to the **0x02 Functions and Nested Loops** repository! This repository is dedicated to understanding functions and nested loops in the world of programming. In this module, we explore how functions help break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts, and how nested loops allow us to repeat actions multiple times to achieve desired results.

## Introduction

Functions play a crucial role in programming, allowing developers to organize code, promote reusability, and enhance readability. This section provides an introduction to functions, their syntax, and best practices for writing effective functions.

## Functions

In this section, we delve deeper into functions, covering different types of functions, function prototypes, how to pass arguments, and return values. We will also explore the concept of recursion, where a function calls itself, and its practical applications.

## Nested Loops

Nested loops enable us to perform repetitive tasks with varying degrees of complexity. This section demonstrates how to use nested loops effectively and provides examples of nested loop patterns for specific use cases.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the programming community to enrich this repository further. If you have any insights, additional examples, or corrections related to functions and nested loops, feel free to submit a pull request.
