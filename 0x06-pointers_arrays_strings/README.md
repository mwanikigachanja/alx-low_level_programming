# 0x06 Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

Welcome to the 0x06 Pointers, Arrays, and Strings directory! In this directory, you will find C language programs that focus on pointers, arrays, and strings. This set of exercises aims to enhance your understanding of memory management, array manipulation, and string handling in C.

## List of Files

Here is a list of the files in this directory:

1. **0-reset_to_98.c**: This program contains a function that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to 98.

2. **1-swap.c**: This program holds a function that swaps the values of two integers using pointers.

3. **2-strlen.c**: This file has a function that calculates and returns the length of a string (the number of characters in it) without using the standard library function `strlen()`.

4. **3-puts.c**: In this file, you will find a function that prints a string to the standard output (stdout).

5. **4-print_rev.c**: This program contains a function that prints a string in reverse.

6. **5-rev_string.c**: This file includes a function that reverses a string in place.

7. **6-puts2.c**: Here, you will find a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.

8. **7-puts_half.c**: This program contains a function that prints the second half of a string.

9. **8-print_array.c**: This file contains a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers.

10. **9-strcpy.c**: In this file, you will find a function that copies the string pointed to by the source, including the null terminator, to the buffer pointed to by the destination.

11. **100-atoi.c**: This program holds a function that converts a string to an integer.

12. **101-keygen.c**: In this file, you will find a C program for a password generator.

## How to Use?

To use these programs, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

3. Navigate to the `0x06-pointers_arrays_strings` directory:

   ```
   cd your-repo/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings
   ```

4. Compile the C files using the C compiler:

   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra *.c -o output_file
   ```

   Replace `output_file` with the desired name for the executable.

5. Run the program:

   ```
   ./output_file
   ```

   Replace `output_file` with the name you used during compilation.

## Notes

- These programs are written in C and have been tested on a Unix-based operating system. While they should work on most systems, there could be some variations or compatibility issues on different platforms.

- Each C file contains comments to explain the purpose and logic of the functions. Feel free to explore the code to understand the implementation details.

- If you encounter any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to contribute, feel free to create a pull request or submit an issue in the repository.

Happy coding!
