## Description

In the `0x0A-argc_argv` directory, you will find examples and exercises that demonstrate how to use the `argc` (argument count) and `argv` (argument vector) parameters in C programming. These parameters are used to access the command-line arguments passed to a program when it is executed.

## Files

- `argv_example.c`: An example program that showcases how to access and utilize the `argc` and `argv` parameters.
- `word_count.c`: A program that counts the number of words in a text input provided as command-line arguments.

## Usage

To use the provided examples and exercises, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired example or exercise folder (`0x0A-argc_argv`).
2. Compile the source files using a C compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

For instance, to compile and run `argv_example.c`:

```bash
gcc argv_example.c -o argv_example
./argv_example arg1 arg2 arg3
```

## How to Compile

To compile the example programs and exercises in this directory, use the following syntax:

```bash
gcc source_file.c -o output_executable
```

For example, to compile `word_count.c`:

```bash
gcc word_count.c -o word_count
```
