## Introduction

Function pointers are a powerful feature in the C programming language that allow you to store and call functions dynamically. This directory serves as a collection of code examples and exercises aimed at helping you understand and master the concept of function pointers.

## Files

- `1-print_name.c`: Demonstrates how to use a function pointer to print a person's name.
- `2-array_iterator.c`: Shows how to apply a function to each element of an array using a function pointer.
- `3-main.c`, `3-op_functions.c`, `3-get_op_func.c`, `3-calc.h`: Implements a basic calculator using function pointers to perform arithmetic operations.
