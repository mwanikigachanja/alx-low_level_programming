# Singly Linked Lists - Project README

Welcome to the Singly Linked Lists project! In this project, we will be exploring the world of linked data structures by implementing and working with singly linked lists. This project is part of the 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists module and will help you gain a deeper understanding of how linked lists work and how they can be manipulated.

## Introduction to Singly Linked Lists

A singly linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node holds two main components: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and can easily grow or shrink. Linked lists offer efficient insertion and deletion operations, making them a fundamental data structure in computer science.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are:

1. **Understanding Linked Lists:** Gain a solid understanding of how singly linked lists are structured and how nodes are connected.

2. **Implementation:** Implement various functions that involve manipulating singly linked lists, such as adding nodes, deleting nodes, and traversing the list.

3. **Practice:** Sharpen your programming skills by working with pointers, memory management, and basic data structure operations.

## Getting Started

To start working on the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this project repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and make sure you are on the appropriate branch.

3. **Review Requirements:** Take a look at the project requirements and the list of functions you need to implement.

4. **Coding Time:** Start implementing the required functions in the provided code files. Feel free to consult the resources and examples as needed.

## Function Implementations

You will be implementing several functions as part of this project, including but not limited to:

- Adding a new node to the beginning of the linked list.
- Adding a new node after a specific node.
- Deleting a node with a given data value.
- Reversing the linked list.
- Finding the length of the linked list.

Remember to thoroughly test each function after implementation to ensure correctness and accuracy.

## Testing Your Code

Testing is an essential part of software development. After implementing each function, write test cases to validate the functionality of your code. Consider edge cases and different scenarios to ensure robustness.

## Contributing
