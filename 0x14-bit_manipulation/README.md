## Introduction

Bit manipulation is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves manipulating individual bits within a binary representation of data. This directory serves as a learning resource to understand how bit manipulation works and how to perform bitwise operations to achieve specific tasks.

## Binary Representation

Learn about the binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols (0 and 1), and how to convert between binary and decimal (base 10) representations.

## Hexadecimal Representation

Explore the hexadecimal numeral system, which uses 16 distinct symbols (0-9 and A-F) to represent values, and learn how to convert between hexadecimal and binary/decimal representations.

## Bitwise Operations

Understand various bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT, and discover how they can be used to manipulate individual bits within numbers.

## Shift Operations

Learn about left and right shift operations, which involve moving the bits of a number to the left or right by a specified number of positions.

## Examples

Find practical examples and use cases that demonstrate how to apply bit manipulation techniques to solve real-world problems. The examples cover scenarios like setting/clearing bits, checking for bit presence, and more.
