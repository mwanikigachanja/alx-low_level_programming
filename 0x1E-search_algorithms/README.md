# 0x1E-search_algorithms Project README

## Overview
Welcome to the 0x1E-search_algorithms project! This project is part of the ALX curriculum and focuses on implementing various search algorithms in C. In this project, you will dive into the world of search algorithms, exploring different techniques to efficiently find elements in arrays or lists.

## Project Structure
The project directory on the GitHub repository is organized as follows:
```
.
├── README.md
├── 0-linear.c
├── 1-binary.c
└── ...
```
- **README.md**: This file contains an overview of the project and instructions on how to use and contribute to it.
- **0-linear.c**: Implementation of the linear search algorithm.
- **1-binary.c**: Implementation of the binary search algorithm.
- **...**: Additional search algorithms may be included in the project directory.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mwanikigachanja/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `0x1E-search_algorithms` directory:
   ```bash
   cd alx-low_level_programming/0x1E-search_algorithms
   ```

3. Review the provided source files (`0-linear.c`, `1-binary.c`, etc.) to understand the implementation of different search algorithms.

4. Compile the source files:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o search_algorithms
   ```

5. Run the compiled executable to test the search algorithms:
   ```bash
   ./search_algorithms
   ```

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for additional search algorithms or improvements to existing ones, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.
